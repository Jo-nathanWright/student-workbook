# Day 34 - Reflection on CheckPoint

## Daily Questions

- Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
  - Pair Programming and User Experience.
- What went well?
  - We stayed on task and didn't leave a part of the site till it was completely finished. We checked and double checked for bugs and managed to come out with a good looking functional site.
- What would you do differently?
  - More Partner Programming and better Code documentaion. While Partner Programming was practiced, It wasn't used as much as it should have been. I would also work on having better communication, which we didn't solve until halfway through the project.

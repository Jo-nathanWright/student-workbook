# Day 46 -  C# Data Types

## Daily Questions

- What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
  - Value type : Holds its data value in it's own memory. ex.(bool a = false)
  - Reference type : Holds an address that points to where the value is being stored. ex. (string b = "reference")
  - Pointer type : Do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.

- What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
  - bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort.
  - There is a lot of more specific data types such as decimal and double for integers

- In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
  - They are given a space in the memory and an address to that space. Refence types only know the address. Value types Know extacly what that value is.

# Day 6 - INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT

## Daily Questions

- What is Scope ?
    - Where these variables are available for use depending on where they are on the page
    <br>
- What is Hoisting ?
    - Hoisting is when variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This applies with variables
- In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    - Since the const variable can never be changed it would be usefull to put them on varibles you wouldn't want changed. Let variables would be more useful in sections of code such as functions. This is due to the fact that they can be changed in diffined differntly in different sections, but never in the same one.

  I have learned Alot over these 11 weeks. I went from having very limited knowledge on javascript to knowing how to make full stack apps. And now the the final is here I feel I know what I need in order to pass. My only concern is that I will over look some of the items we went over. For the final I plan on finishing at least 2 sections of codes a work day. The best thing about this course was the people I meet while I was here. Here's to a bright coding future!

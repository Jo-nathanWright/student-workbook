# Day 2 - Review of HTML/CSS

## Daily Questions

- What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
    - A Pseudo-Class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state for that selector.Some Impoartant Classes are:
        * The child-class(nth-child)
        * The type-class(nth-of-type)
        * The hover-class
    - Some that I will most likely use are The ones for checking were a user is or what they have done on my website.
        
- What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
    - Specificity is css deciding with rule should be applyed when there are multiple rules targeting the same element.
    - I will most likley use it to have multiple rules for one element (Div for example) but use a .example to add Specificity so I can have multiple Div rules with all of them working for their specific areas.
- What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
    - Since !important prioritizes the style that it's next to, it overrides all other style options for that item. So if I have a div.box thats green and I write !important next to an original div color, it will overwrite green for the original div color.

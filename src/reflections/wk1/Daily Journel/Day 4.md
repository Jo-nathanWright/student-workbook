# Day 4 - Wire-Framing, Design Tools and Review

## Daily Questions

- What is the purpose of wire-framing?
    - To layout a webpage or app before designing in in html and css. It also allows stakeholders who may not have tech lingo be able to see how an webpage will function, both visual and user flow wise.

- What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
    - Low-fidelity
        - These are good for starting conversations on user flow and the navigation layout of a site. These are also usefull when you need to share alot of wireframes in a short amount of time
    - Mid-fidelity 
        - These are more accurate representations of the layout of the site. These are also often created digitaly.
    - High-fidelity
        - These are very accuret representations of what the finished web site will lock like, having percise pixel measurements and the words that would go on the page. These are usally saved for the end of wireframing
- Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    - Yes, because they help you visualy format your website or app before you begin making it. They allow you to know where you'll need to code and what the finished project should look like.
